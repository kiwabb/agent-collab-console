## Scenario: Durable Conductor Runner Leases

### 1. Scope / Trigger

- Trigger: changing Conductor orchestration state, `conductor_tasks` schema, startup recovery, or watchdog behavior.
- Conductor loops are in-memory coroutines, but their user-visible task state is durable. Any `running` Conductor row must include enough persisted lease data to distinguish a live runner from a stale database row after backend reload/crash.

### 2. Signatures

- DB table: `conductor_tasks`
- Lease columns:
  - `lease_owner TEXT`
  - `heartbeat_at TEXT`
  - `lease_expires_at TEXT`
- Store APIs:
  - `save_conductor_task(task: ConductorTask) -> None`
  - `load_conductor_task(task_id: str) -> ConductorTask | None`
  - `load_latest_conductor_task_for_issue(issue_id: str) -> ConductorTask | None`
  - `list_conductor_tasks(*, status: str | None = None) -> list[ConductorTask]`
- Recovery API:
  - `recover_orphaned_conductors(store, *, event_bus, current_owner, stale_after_s, recover_foreign_owner=False) -> int`
- Environment keys:
  - `CONDUCTOR_LEASE_TTL_S` default `180`
  - `CONDUCTOR_RECOVERY_INTERVAL_S` default `30`
  - `CONDUCTOR_RECOVERY_ENABLED` default enabled

### 3. Contracts

- A live `run_issue_conductor_loop` must set `lease_owner`, `heartbeat_at`, and `lease_expires_at` on the initial `ConductorTask`.
- A live loop must refresh the lease before persisted turns and phase transitions.
- `lease_owner` format is `pid:<pid>:<uuid>` and is process-local, not per task.
- Recovery scans only `status == "running"` conductor tasks.
- Recovery marks orphaned tasks as `status="stalled"` and `payload.phase="stalled"`, never as `failed`.
- Recovery must preserve `paused`, `done`, `failed`, and already `stalled` tasks.
- Recovery must persist an auditable reason in both `payload` and `result_json`.
- Recovery must emit the existing `conductor_status` event path via `transition_conductor_phase`.

### 4. Validation & Error Matrix

- `lease_expires_at <= now` -> mark `stalled` with reason `orphaned_conductor_runner`.
- No `lease_expires_at`, but `heartbeat_at`/`updated_at`/`created_at` older than `stale_after_s` -> mark `stalled`.
- Startup with `recover_foreign_owner=True` and `lease_owner` pid no longer exists -> mark `stalled` even if the stored expiry is still in the future.
- Startup with foreign owner pid alive and fresh lease -> keep `running`.
- `status` in `paused`, `done`, `failed`, or `stalled` -> do not modify.
- Store without `list_conductor_tasks` -> recovery returns `0` and does not crash startup.

### 5. Good/Base/Bad Cases

- Good: backend reload sees `running / awaiting_llm` with `lease_owner="pid:12345:..."`; pid `12345` no longer exists, so startup marks the row `stalled` and records previous phase/owner.
- Base: a currently running loop heartbeats every persisted turn/phase and remains `running`.
- Bad: a second-round `llm_request` is persisted, the backend reloads, and the row stays forever in `running / awaiting_llm` because there is no durable lease to recover.
- Bad: marking an orphaned Conductor as `failed`, which makes an infrastructure loss look like product/task failure.

### 6. Tests Required

- Regression: expired `running` Conductor becomes `stalled`.
- Regression: fresh `running` Conductor remains `running`.
- Regression: dead foreign owner on startup becomes `stalled`.
- Regression: live foreign owner with fresh lease remains `running`.
- Regression: `paused`, `done`, `failed`, and `stalled` rows are untouched.
- Loop test: `run_issue_conductor_loop` persists lease fields.
- Lifespan test: startup calls recovery and starts the periodic Conductor watchdog.

### 7. Wrong vs Correct

Wrong:

```python
task.status = "running"
await store.save_conductor_task(task)
```

Correct:

```python
now = datetime.now()
task.status = "running"
task.lease_owner = get_conductor_lease_owner()
task.heartbeat_at = now
task.lease_expires_at = now + timedelta(seconds=get_conductor_lease_ttl_s())
await store.save_conductor_task(task)
```
