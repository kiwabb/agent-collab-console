# State Management

> How state is managed in the ccgui frontend package.

---

## Overview

The project does **not** use Redux, Zustand, Jotai, or any other external
state library. State lives in three places, in this priority order:

1. **Local component state** (`useState`, `useReducer`) — the default.
2. **React context** — a small number of app-wide providers
   (`I18nProvider`, `ThemeProvider`, `PreferencesProvider`,
   `ExecutionProcessesContext`). New providers are an exception, not the
   rule.
3. **Server state** — re-fetched on mount, kept in local state, patched
   by `useBusEventEffect` for live updates. No client cache.

A component reaches for `useContext` only when a value is genuinely
needed by siblings in different subtrees (e.g. workspace id, theme,
live event stream). Anything else stays in local state and travels
through props or composition.

## State Categories

| Category | Where it lives | Examples |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| **Component UI** | `useState` inside the component | form values, accordion open/closed, hover state |
| **Cross-component feature state** | React context provider in `providers/` | workspace id, current user prefs, live event stream |
| **Server / network data** | Local `useState`, refreshed on mount and on relevant WS events | issue detail, task list, cost stats, budget snapshot |
| **URL state** | `useSearchParams` / `usePathname` from `next/navigation` | active tab, command-palette query, project sort |
| **Persistence** | `localStorage` via `usePreferencesProvider` (theme, language) | user-preference toggles |
| **Global short-lived** | `EventBus` (server) + `useBusEventEffect` (client) | per-issue cost growth, budget warning, task status |

Rule of thumb: if only one component reads it, it's local. If two
siblings read it, lift to a parent. If two features in different trees
read it, context. If two browser tabs need to see the same value, the
server.

## When to Use Global State

A new piece of state belongs in a **React context** only if all of the
following are true:

- It is read by components in **two or more unrelated subtrees** (not
  just parent → child).
- It is **inherently app-wide** (theme, locale, workspace id, live
  event stream). Per-feature concerns stay in the feature.
- It is **not** a snapshot of server data — server data is re-fetched
  on mount and patched via `useBusEventEffect`, not stored in a
  long-lived context.

A new context provider requires a corresponding hook in `hooks/`
(`useXxx`) that re-throws if used outside the provider — this is the
mechanism that keeps "where do I read this from?" obvious.

**Do not** introduce Zustand / Redux / Jotai for the convenience of one
component. The existing tree is the source of truth.

## Server State

Server data follows a uniform pattern:

1. **Fetch on mount** (and on `reloadKey` change) via a small async
   helper. Multiple fetches in a panel are combined in a single
   `Promise.all` so the page does not serialize them.
2. **Cache the response in local `useState`**. Refresh by re-running
   the same fetch.
3. **Patch from the live event bus** using `useBusEventEffect`:
   - match by `issueId` / `taskId` / `type` via `busEventMatchers`
   - throttle to `>= 600ms` when the same panel re-renders many cards
     in a burst (the standard case is the conductor settling 3 stages
     in 200ms)
   - cleanup is mandatory: the hook itself handles timer cleanup, but
     callers must not add their own long-lived subscriptions on top
4. **Polling** is reserved for the active-state-only cases (e.g. the
   budget meter polls every 30s while the issue is running, and stops
   the moment the issue is done/idle). The default is **no polling** —
   if the WS event stream can keep a value current, do not add a poll.

A typed return is mandatory: `Promise<MyType | null>` where `null` is
the failure case. Callers branch on `null`, never on thrown errors.

## Common Mistakes

- **Adding `useEffect` to "sync" two pieces of state.** If component A
  sets state and component B re-derives it from A's state in an effect,
  the derivation should be a `useMemo` (or a plain inline expression),
  not an effect. The "derived in render" pattern is the correct one.
- **Storing a snapshot of server data in a context provider.** The
  page that owns the fetch owns the state. If two pages need the same
  snapshot, they each fetch it (the request is deduped at the
  `dedupedFetch` layer in `lib/api.ts`).
- **Mutating state in place.** `useState` is reference-comparison; if
  you push into an array, React will not re-render. Always return a
  new array/object.
- **Forgetting event-bus cleanup.** `useBusEventEffect` handles
  internal timer cleanup, but if you add a `useEffect` with
  `addEventListener` outside it, you must return a cleanup that
  removes the listener. Stale listeners leak memory and double-fire.
- **Polling a value the WS already streams.** If the server emits an
  event for a value change, do not also poll it. The poll is for
  values whose growth is silent below a threshold (budget spend before
  soft-warn, for example) — not a substitute for the event stream.
